Description: Docker client library in Go
 Client for the Docker remote API with support for the extensions in the
 Swarm API.
 .
 This package also provides support for docker's network API, which is a
 simple passthrough to the libnetwork remote API.  Note that docker's
 network API is only available in docker 1.8 and above, and only enabled in
 docker if DOCKER_EXPERIMENTAL is defined during the docker build process.
